## We may transfer this agreement to someone else

**We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation. We will always tell you in writing if this happens and we will ensure that the transfer will not affect your rights under the contract.**


## Intellectual property rights

We are the owner or the licensee of all intellectual property rights in our site and its content, including the Parity and Substrate names and marks, as well as the material published on it. Those works are protected by intellectual property laws and treaties around the world. All such rights are reserved.

You are not granted any right to use, and may not use, any of our intellectual property rights other than as set out in these terms. You must not commercially exploit our site (or any part of it or its content); however, you may download material from our site solely for internal, non-commercial, personal use by you. Our status (and that of any identified contributors) as the authors of content on our site must always be acknowledged.

Save as required by applicable law, you shall not copy, reproduce, republish, upload, re-post, modify, transmit, distribute or otherwise use in any way for any non-personal, public or commercial purpose any part of our site including (without limitation) the text, designs, graphics, photographs, images and user generated content of other users without our prior written consent and (in the case of user generated content of a different user) the prior written consent of that user.

You retain all ownership rights you have in the user generated content, but you hereby grant to us a perpetual, transferable, royalty-free license, irrevocable, worldwide, sub-licensable license to use, copy, modify, adapt, prepare derivative works from, distribute, perform and display your user generated content and any name, username, voice or likeness provided in connection with your user generated content in all media formats and channels now known or later developed. This license includes the right for us to make your user generated content available for syndication, broadcast, distribution or publication by other companies, organisations or individuals who partner with us. You also agree that we may remove metadata associated with your user generated content, and you irrevocably waive any claims and assertions of moral rights or attribution with respect to your user generated content. 

If you copy, reproduce, republish, upload, re-post, modify, transmit, distribute or otherwise use any part of the content on our site in breach of these terms of use, your right to use our site will cease immediately and you must, at our option, return or destroy any copies of the materials you have made.


## User-generated content is not approved by us

In some sections of our site, you may be able to view, interact with or upload content generated by others. You may be able to supply or upload content to our site – whether it be pictures, text, sound recordings, code or whatever –  where you are able to do so the content you supply (“user generated content”) must conform with these terms. 

You agree that you are solely responsible for any user generated content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available through certain sections of our site, regardless of the form of that content and that you bear responsibility for any harm caused by such content. 

Our site may contain or include information and materials uploaded by other users of the site. This information and these materials have not been verified or approved by us. We take no responsibility for, and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, any content – whether it be software built on substrate, pictures, text, sound recordings or whatever - supplied or uploaded by a user to our site. The views expressed by other users on our site through user generated content do not represent our views or values. User generated content is displayed on our sites as submitted and we do not perform any type of checks or verifications on it. We therefore cannot guarantee that any user generated content uploaded or shared to our site is correct, accurate, free of error or bugs. You therefore agree to be fully responsible for the way you decide to use or interact in any way with user generated content on our site.

While we do not screen nor perform checks on user generated content, we may, at our sole discretion, resolve to delete in whole or in part any user generated content that contravenes our acceptable use policy or goes against any other of our policies and / or terms of use for our site.
We have the right to disclose your identity to any third party who is claiming that any content posted or uploaded by you to our site constitutes a violation of their intellectual property rights or of their right to privacy.

We will not be responsible or liable to any third party, for the content or accuracy of any content posted by you or any other user of our site.

You are solely responsible for securing and backing up your content.


## No reliance on information

The content on our site is provided for general information only. It is not intended to amount to advice on which you should rely. You must obtain professional or specialist advice before taking, or refraining from, any action on the basis of the content on our site.

Although we make reasonable efforts to update the information on our site, we make no representations, warranties or guarantees, whether express or implied, that the content on our site is accurate, complete, up-to-date or bug free.


## Interactive services

We may from time to time provide interactive services on our site, including, without limitation:

- Substrate Marketplace
- Substrate Playground

Your use of these services  may be governed by separate terms and conditions. Please refer to them where necessary. However, please note that these services are made available free of charge. We do not guarantee that they, or any of their content will always be available or be uninterrupted. Access to them is permitted on a temporary basis. We may suspend, withdraw, discontinue or change all or any part of those services without notice. We will not be liable to you if for any reason those services are unavailable at any time or for any period. We may update the services and/or change their content at any time.

We employ our best efforts to ensure that our services are secure, virus and bug free but we cannot warrant this will always be the case. Whenever you choose to use these services or download any content from them, whether uploaded by us, generated by you through the interactive services or any user generated content, you acknowledge that you do so at your own risk and responsibility. We are not responsible nor liable for any bugs, viruses or damages that may arise as a consequence of your use of these services or the content within them.

We take no responsibility for, and we do not expressly or implicitly endorse, any user generated content. By submitting your user generated content, you represent and warrant that you have all rights, power and authority necessary to grant the rights to such user generated content as set out in these terms. As you alone are responsible for your user generated content, you may expose yourself to liability if you post or share user generated content without all necessary rights.

We do not oversee, monitor or moderate any user generated content which is uploaded to our site. If you become aware of any user generated content that contravenes these terms, please contact us on legal@parity.io, providing details of: (i) the date on which it was posted and where it can be found on our site; (ii) the name and surname of the author or, if the author is a legal person, the author's business name; (iii) reasons why the content should be deleted; and (vi) copies of any communication with the author (if any).
